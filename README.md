A railway is a road transport system that uses trains that run on rails (rails).

 Rail transport is used to transport passengers and goods by trains and wagons specially designed to run on iron rails.  The railway connects the cities to each other in the same country and is included in the railway network;  It also connects countries and the networks of a country are intertwined with those of its neighbours, and often an entire continent is linked by a great network of railways.  Almost all types of railroad trains run on iron wheels with a rim fixed to two iron bars.  The rails are laid on thick beams of wood, cement or iron that are fixed to the ground, keeping the rails parallel and stable. The railways are designed so that they can bear the weight of running trailers and wagons.  There are also trains running on rubber wheels running on two non-wide rails of reinforced concrete, as in the Paris metro and other metros in France such as the Véhicule automatique léger, the M3 metro line for the Lausanne metro, the Montreal metro as well as the Skyline Shuttle for Frankfurt Airport in Germany.  In the past decades, railways have been developed, increasing their speeds, and running on electricity, reaching speeds of more than 300 kilometers per hour.  Among those high-speed trains are the Tokyo-Osaka train in Japan called the Shinkansen, the TGV train in France between Paris and Lyon, and the trains of German railways, among others.
